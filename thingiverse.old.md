Summary

Just a quick remix of lessananon1's afterburner bracket to fit an Ender 3 V2 plate with a BLTouch.

It only fits the V2. There'sa big bolt in the way interfereing with the voron style inductive probe, so I added a brace where that should go for a bit more rigidity.

The rest of the afterburner is on the voron github https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner

I'm using this 5015 fan mod https://github.com/Greg191134/Voron/tree/master/Afterburner%20Optimisation/5015%20fan%20mod

Best printed in ABS with 4 perimeters, 5 top and bottom layers and 40% infil as per voron specs. eSun ABS+ works well if you don't have an enclosue and the draft shiled option in prusaSlicer/superslicer really helps.

Even using a cardboard box as an enclosure helps, i have an ABS prusa in a lack box and am using it to build a voron, but everyththing has afterburners as the part interchangability is really helpful, as is breing able to use the same filament settings on every printer.

You will need to print the fan duct in ABS or ASA and the clockwork extruder needs to be PETG if unenclosed or ABS if enclosed. Don't consider this if you can only print PLA.

This is GNU GPL V3, thingiverse doesn't do licencing properly. lessananon1's part uses the voron source so must be GPL V3, I'm including attribution as a courtesy.
